BANK LOAN REPORT SCRIPT OVERVIEW
This script analyzes bank loan performance data, providing insights through several key sections:
A. SUMMARY KPIs: Calculates overall and month-specific metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts,
   received payments, average interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
B. GOOD vs BAD LOANS: Breaks down loan performance into 'Good' (Fully Paid/Current) and 'Bad' (Charged Off) categories,
   evaluating application counts, funded amounts, and payment received for each.
C. LOAN STATUS ANALYSIS: Summarizes performance metrics by each loan status, both overall and for December 2021.
D. OVERVIEW TRENDS: Presents trend analyses by issue month, geographic state, loan term, employee length, loan purpose,
   and home ownership status to understand borrower characteristics and funding behavior.
